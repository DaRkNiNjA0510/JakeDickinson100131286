With not being familer with java coding in general i first decided to try and create the music menu first with what limited knowleagement i had with java coding. 

First off i decided to look up on W3Schools to have a look on what i needed to do to start inputting the coding that i needed to do to start creating my music menu, i decided to follow the coding that was provided to me within the section of W3 schools i was looking under and modified it so that it worked more like a menu instead of what it was intended to do.

ive gotten to the part where i needed enter the coding for adding, removing, printing the playlist and printing a list of songs that had a given number of plays provided by the user.

After reseraching on google for creating a playlist and song menu ive been given different results but ive managed to find one that looked like it could be the correct one and currently going to double check it to see if everything is correct and is working correctly and make any changes to the coding if needed.

so far with doing this assignment i have gained a better understanding of using java coding more then i previously did though the lectures possibly due to i learn better though trial and error as it syncs in better with what limited knowleage i have gained though lectures alone.

after creating the initial code for what i needed to do with my assignment i realised that replit has an ai feature built in so i asked that to see if my coding is correct and to improve the coding in areas where it needs improving on. 

later down the line ive managed to impliment an array as a seperate file for now due to not knowing if i need to add into a coding file ive already made or it needed to be seperate file overall for it all to work in the end due to not knowing if i need to add it into a certain file or keep it seperate to the rest



Features thats included in this are:

Adding a song into a playlist by song name, artist name and play count
Removing a song from a playlist by song name, artist name and play count
Being able to print the playlist with all the songs included

After looking over the coding i found out that i could not test the coding properly due to replit giving a few implications so ive ended up cloning the archive into netbeans to be able to test out all the coding properly and was about to find any errors within my coding or they work as intended

After going over the coding to see if everything is correct or to an acceptable level i found out that i needed to merge certain coding into my main java file so ive ended up adding all the nessessary coding into the main java file and was left with the nessessary files i needed for the aassignment.

After managing to merge some of the coding into my main.java file i realised i made some configeration errors so i relooked back though the coding ive done within my Main.java file and corrected any configeration errors ive made and started trying to add any final touchs and see if all the coding works as intended within all my java files before submitting my work
